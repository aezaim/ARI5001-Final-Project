The shortest_path.py file visualizes the path selected. It is currently set to model the larger problem. The edges and positions for the smaller are included in the file but they are commented out. 
You need to copy/paste the edges and positions lists of the smaller problem and change the goal nodes from 'O' to 'F' in the function calls to simulate the smaller problem
The mem_tracking.py file prints out the peak and current memory usages of both A* and Dijkstra algorithms
